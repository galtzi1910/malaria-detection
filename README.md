# malaria-detection"
A simple project to test your GPU on actual A.I training

# Simple Run
the `simple_run.ipynb` notebook is a simplified version which holds only the cells you need in order to train a simple A.I model on the malaria detection dataset

# All Tries
the `all_tries.ipynb` notebook is a version which holds all my different attempts (tried to keep it somewhat clean but it is still very messy), it's there if you want to draw some inspiration or run `wandb`

# API
the `api/` directory shows the usage of `fastapi` for simple api deployment

# Locust
the `load_testing/` directory shows the usage of `locust` for simple load testing
